		<p>
			The Author intends for users to be able to use the functionality of the App on a
			decentralized, anonymous basis. The Author therefore does not collect, use, maintain or share
			any personal information about you when you use the App, and the Author does not use any
			tracking technology to track your use of the App. The Author also does not allow third parties
			to collect personal information about you when you use the App, or to use tracking technology

		<h2 class="text-xl font-bold">B. Third Party App Stores.</h2>
		<p>
			If you purchase or access the App through a third party app store, such as iTunes or Google
			Play (an “App Store”), you will have a separate, additional account relationship with that App
			Store and the information you provide to that App Store will be handled in accordance with the
			privacy practices of the applicable App Store. App Stores are not partners or representatives
			of the Author and the Author is not responsible for the acts or omissions of an App Store with
			regard to the collection, use, maintenance or disclosure of your information. If you want to
			change your preferences with regard to how an applicable App Store collects or uses your
			information, you should review the privacy practices of the applicable App Store and adjust
			your privacy or other settings directly through the applicable App Store. The Author will not
			receive or have access to any of the information you provide to, or that is collected by, an
			applicable App Store.

			the App at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. If you do not
