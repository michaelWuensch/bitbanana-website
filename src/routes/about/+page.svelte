	We believe in a future where choosing self-custody is an option for everyone, not just for bitcoin
	wizards. Operating a lightning node has to become as simple as peeling a banana! Therefore, our
	goal is to provide a user experience that can stand up against custodial solutions, all while
	preserving privacy and self-custody.
	<br /><br />
	A big thank you to all the contributors who have played a part in our journey so far.
	<br /><br />
	Ok, no more talking, it's time for action! Download the app now and go full bananas with your node.
	Have fun!
